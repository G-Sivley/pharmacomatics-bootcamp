# Pharmcomatics Bootcamp
Do you have an interest in pharmacy informatics?
Well, where do you start??? <br>
In an industry that is so saught after, why is there not explicit training? <br>

## Purpose
This website is available to provide new or seasoned pharmacists with the resources for developing their skills in informatics.

## Who is it for?
1. Pharmacy students looking to get a job in the industry post pharmacy school
2. Current pharmacists looking to change specialties
3. Informaticists that are looking to develop specific skills for job related requirements

### My story
My name is Grant Sivley and I am a pharmacy informaticist. Many current informaticists fell into their job because of requirements at their specific facility. I was afforded the opportunity to take a much more stuctured approach. I am currently completing a PGY1/2 in pharmacy informatics which provided me with an abundance of knowledge and real life experience that I can apply in my current position. But prior to that opportunity, I ran into the problem of: **How do I get experience on my own time?** I wanted to learn how to be the best informaticists through YouTube, blogs, and websites. Unfortunately, there was a lack of practical information skills available that I could bring to an employer.

## Goals of this site
On this website, I would like to provide real life training exercises to sharpen your skills in pharmacy informatics. Outside of that I would like to provide an area for informaticists to collaborate to solve problems as a team.
